            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>
              Over the past four years I have been dabbling in the world of game development
              Initially I started by attempting to make a 2D game in Unity that would aim to be
              a "rogue-like" with inspirations drawn from "The Legend of Zelda, a Link to the Past."
              However, after some time working on this project I decided to that even though I had become
              quite good at creating pixel art, that it was not something that I wanted to focus my time on.
              So, I decided to move into 3D games.

            <h3>Into Three Dimentions</h3>
            <p>
              Creating games in 3D was initially an extremely daunting process, and learning the
              Unity itself was difficult. However, since I had some experience from creating my
              first 2D game, this was a bit easier. The idea behind the project was large in scope,
              I wanted to create an open world game that would allow the player to take full
              control of other inhabitants of their world. The player would then be able
              to esentially record paths and jobs of these inhabitants and optimize the efficiency of
              their town or campsites. The world would contain different types of enemy outposts, 
              bases, and strongholds. These enemies would also mount attacks to raid the players
              town. This idea while cool, was way outside the scope of what I could create on my own.
              After several months of development the project had become extremely difficult to work on
              because there were so many unfinished pieces. Unfortunately, out of frustration I decided
              to delete the scene and start over. I did this thinking that starting over would allow me
              to use the parts that I created previously to quickly put things back together in a more orginized way.
              However, during this reconstruction time I began to get overwhelmed with my University 
              coursework. This led me to forget how exactly everything was put together. In the future,
              I hope to find time to tackle the project again.

            <h3>Keep it Simple</h3>
            <p>
              My latest attempt in creating a game was much more inside of the scope of my abilities.
              The idea behind this game is that it would follow the tried and true template of a Top
              Down RPG, and it would strongly take inspiration from games like "Champions of Norath"
              and "Gauntlet Legends". The game was coming along nicely, and character and enemy movement
              were nearly finished in only a few weeks. I was also able to get attacking animations working for the
              player. The game is still being developed, but I am currently learning the Unreal Engine, and I
              am planning on rebuilding the project using Unreal.
